### Research Experience 
 **2019-Present**
 : **Research Assistant, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis Laboratory, University of Arkansas**
   : • Using yeast as a model organism for Parkinson's Disease, I study the role natural variation plays in wild yeast's response to alpha-synuclein toxicity. 
   
 **June-July 2018**
: **Summer Medical and Research Training Program (SMART), Baylor College of Medicine** 
  : •	Worked in a project mentored by Dr. Kjersti Aagaard called “Maternal Commensal Bacteria Inhibits Intrauterine ZIKV Infection and Fetal Growth Restriction in a Mouse Model,” which involved working with RNA and DNA extractions from different types of tissues and performing and analyzing RT-qPCR data.  
  
 **June-July 2017**
: **Summer Medical and Research Training Program (SMART), Baylor College of Medicine** 
  : •	Worked in a project mentored by Dr. Fred Pereira from the Huffington Center on Aging called “Antioxidant Carbon Nanoparticle Results in Novel Auditory Response in Mice,” which involved working with mice and practicing techniques such as brain and ear isolation, dissection, q-PCR, brain signal processing, and data analysis. 
  
**2016-2019**
: **Independent Research, University of the Ozarks** 
  : •	With Dr. Sean Coleman as an advisor, I have worked in projects involving bacterial count, antibiotic resistance assays, and microbiome analysis of water, soil, toothbrush, and cow feces samples.
